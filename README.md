# SoundMatcher

## Steps to run the code
* `git clone https://github.com/revanshu/sound-matcher.git`
* `cd sound-matcher/`
* Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Questions 

Why this Layout?
* To make it more UX friendly such that user does not have to move to some other page or modal and can do all the matching in a single screen
* This involved lesser click to resolve sound recordings

What would you do to improve user experience?
* Add clear message to show that input is resolved or not
* Proper messages for errors
* Able to revert changes if something is done by mistake
